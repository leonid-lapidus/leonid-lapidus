Hi all\
Let me tell you a few words about myself\
I'm Leonid Lapidus.\
Usually people ask me about my surname.\
Well, in hebrew my surname means fire-torch, and in Latin it means stone.\
It's just a curious fact.

I graduated from SUSU in 2007 and I'm a systems engineer in electronics.\
Now I have a Master's degree in systems corporate management\
I had been working as a software developer in large international high-tech corporation for a few years after my graduation.\
Then I founded my own digital company, and now I'm the Chief Product Officer.

Also I'm an international expert in Worldskills.\
The skill team I am responsible for got the bronze medal in the world competition last August in Kazan.

I wrote a book about product management.

I am a sociable person and I have lots of friends from all over the world.\
My passions are technologies and getting new knowledge.\
I like science, classical and rock music and travelling.

Time to time I post my thoughts in my Telegram channel, if you're interested - just subscribe: https://t.me/leonid_lapidus

I'm looking forward for new opportunities and challenges in my professional sphere - so if you have any idea or a project, I would be glad to help you.
